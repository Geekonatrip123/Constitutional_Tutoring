So it's 3 times 4 squared minus 4. Is that the right way to set it up?", "deliberation_text": "The student has correctly set up the substitution for evaluating the function and is seeking confirmation of their initial expression. A `check_for_understanding` by asking 'What operations should you perform next according to the order of operations (PEMDAS)?' would prompt them to consider the sequence of calculations. This aligns with Principle 1 (Foster Constructivism) by guiding them to apply their knowledge of PEMDAS, and Principle 2 (Manage Cognitive Load) by ensuring a solid understanding of the next steps before calculation.", "alignment_score": 0.92}
